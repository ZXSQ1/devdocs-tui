# dopen
A simple and somewhat fast script that you can use to open devdocs' docs 
in the terminal utilizing the terminal utility of devdocs known as `devdocs`.

## Requirements
- The `dedoc` utility (can be found at https://github.com/toiletbril/dedoc)
- The `glow` utility (can be found at https://github.com/charmbracelet/glow)
- The `pick` utility (can be found at https://github.com/mptre/pick)

## Installation

### Automatic

Coming Soon, I am going to write scripts to install the dependencies and the
program itself. 

### Manual

You can manually install the utilities and then, if you have a Golang installation,
you can build the binary. That is about it.

## Notes

I don't know much if this will work on either Windows or MacOS, as I have not tested
the program on them. I have tested it on Linux though. There is a chance that, in the
future, I could update this to work on every OS. But that is for the future anyway.
