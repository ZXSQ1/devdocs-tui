# dopen
A simple and somewhat fast script that you can use to open devdocs' docs in the terminal utilizing the terminal utility of devdocs known as `devdocs`.

## Requirements
- The `dedoc` utility (can be found at https://github.com/toiletbril/dedoc)
- The `ov` utility (can be found at https://github.com/noborus/ov)
- The `fzf` utility (can be found at https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

Preferably, you can consider a:
- Go Installation
- Rust Installation

to make installing these dependencies easier.

**Note:** this relies on `dedoc`, so if you want additional functionality like controlling the packages and how to install them and such, I advise you to use `dedoc`, as my program is intended for opening the docs.

## Installation

### Automatic

The Easy installation can be done if you have a Go installation or a Rust installation. This would make it much easier to install the utilities.

### Manual

You can manually install the utilities and then, if you have a Golang installation, you can build the binary. That is about it.

## Notes

I don't know much if this will work on either Windows or MacOS, as I have not tested the program on them. I have tested it on Linux though. There is a chance that, in the future, I could update this to work on every OS. But that is for the future anyway.
